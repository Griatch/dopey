# MyPaint-xsheet (Temporary name)

MyPaint-xsheet is a program for traditional 2D animation based on [MyPaint](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/) and an old fork of it, [xsheet-mypaint](https://gitorious.org/~manuq/mypaint/xsheet-mypaint) by [Manuq](https://gitorious.org/~manuq). In May 2013, I forked xsheet-mypaint, updated it to MyPaint HEAD, started adding features, and switched the name around for maximum confusion.

MyPaint-xsheet is a temporary name until I can think of a better one. This program is not endorsed or supported by any of the MyPaint developers, but we can all agree that they're pretty rockin' because they make the fantastic paint backend that MyPaint-xsheet relies on so much.
