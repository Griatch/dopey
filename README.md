# Dopey

Dopey is a program for traditional 2D animation based on [MyPaint](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/) and an old fork of it, [xsheet-mypaint](https://gitorious.org/~manuq/mypaint/xsheet-mypaint) by [Manuq](https://gitorious.org/~manuq). In May 2013, I forked xsheet-mypaint, updated it to MyPaint HEAD, and started adding features.

This program is not endorsed or supported by any of the MyPaint developers, but we can all agree that they're pretty rockin' because they make the fantastic paint backend and most of the UI that Dopey relies on so much.
