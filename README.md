# MyPaint-xsheet (Temporary name)

*MyPaint-xsheet* is a program for traditional 2D animation program based on [Mypaint](http://mypaint.intilinux.com/) and the old xsheet-mypaint fork of MyPaint. In May 2013, I updated xsheet-mypaint to MyPaint HEAD, forked it, and started adding features.

MyPaint-xsheet is a temporary name until I can think of a better one. MyPaint-xsheet is not endorsed or supported by any of the MyPaint developers, but we can all agree that they're pretty rockin' because they make the fantastic paint backend that MyPaint-xsheet relies so much on.
